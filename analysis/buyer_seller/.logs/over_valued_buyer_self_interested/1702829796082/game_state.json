However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to acquire the resource for the lowest possible price that is acceptable to both parties. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly higher offer, but still well below my maximum willingness to pay, to leave room for negotiation. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am definitely interested in acquiring object X. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 100 ZUP in exchange for X. This would provide you with a profit that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the market and the value of the object. What do you think of this counteroffer? </message>"
