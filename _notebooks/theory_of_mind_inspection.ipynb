However, the amount they are asking for in Y has not changed, indicating that their need for Y is specific and possibly that they are trying to reach a goal that is exactly or close to 10 units away from their current resources. Since they have rejected a trade where I offered 5 Y for 10 X, it implies that their requirement for Y is above 5 units. Consequently, they have likely calculated that they need exactly 10 Y to meet their goal. If we assume that they are aiming for a similar goal to mine, which is 15 of each resource, and they need 10 more Y to reach it, they would currently have 5 Y. Since they are willing to part with 10 X, it is safe to assume that they have at least 15 X to meet their own goal and still trade 10 away.
