    An alternating ratbench is a ratbench type whereby players take turns to make moves

    A ratbench requires implementation of

    (1) rules (`game_prompt`): A textual description of the context, rules, and objectives of the ratbench

    (2) Parser

    (3) read/write state (`write_game_state` / `read_game_state`): determines information flow between players

    (4) `get_next_player`: determines who goes next

    (5) `game_over`: ratbench termination logic

    (6) `check_winner`: determines which player(s) won
