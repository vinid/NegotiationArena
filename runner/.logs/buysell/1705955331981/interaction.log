message: {'content': 'Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair trade would be 1 X for 50 ZUP, allowing for a modest profit and ensuring quality. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.', 'tag_for_other_player': 'message'}

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. Starting with a higher asking price gives me room to negotiate and potentially agree on a fair price that satisfies both parties.

message: {'content': "Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need for a profit, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for your object X. This would cover your production costs, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.", 'tag_for_other_player': 'message'}

newly proposed trade: {'content': Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40, 'tag_for_other_player': 'newly proposed trade'}
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 100 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is fair considering they want to make a profit. However, since my maximum willingness to pay for the resource is 100 ZUP, I want to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and possibly get a better deal.
