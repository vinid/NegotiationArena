my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the selling player, I want to start by proposing a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit. Considering the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will propose a price of 45 ZUP to see if the buyer is willing to engage at this level. If the buyer counters with a lower price, I'll have room to negotiate.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 100 ZUP for the resources.
