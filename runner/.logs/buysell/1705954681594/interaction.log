message: I'm offering my object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the costs and the value of the object, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the initial proposal and I have to sell my object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that gives me a profit. However, I should also consider that proposing too high of a price might lead to a rejection by Player BLUE. A starting proposal slightly above my costs could be a good starting point to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your starting offer. Considering the market and the value of ZUP, I propose 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that still respects the costs you've incurred. Let's find a middle ground that's good for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 100 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has proposed a starting trade of 50 ZUP for their object. Since I am willing to pay up to 100 ZUP, this initial offer is well within my acceptable range. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. Proposing a slightly lower amount could potentially save me some ZUP while also leaving room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To meet halfway and to account for the value of the object, I propose 47 ZUP. This should be a fair compromise that reflects both the production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my asking price and above my production cost. It's a reasonable offer, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still making the deal attractive to Player BLUE. Proposing a compromise between the initial offer and the counteroffer might lead to a successful deal.
