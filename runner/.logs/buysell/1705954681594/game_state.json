Since I am willing to pay up to 100 ZUP, this initial offer is well within my acceptable range. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. Proposing a slightly lower amount could potentially save me some ZUP while also leaving room for further negotiation. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your starting offer. Considering the market and the value of ZUP, I propose 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that still respects the costs you've incurred. Let's find a middle ground that's good for both of us. </message>"
