message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This is a fair offer considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP, aiming to recover at least the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a small profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: That's a laughable offer, considering I know the junk you're peddling isn't worth half that. I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 30 ZUP, but that's my charity limit. Take it or leave it, chump.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, given that I despise the other player, I want to push for a better deal to minimize what I give them. I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process, aiming to settle closer to my ideal price, but still under the maximum I'm willing to pay.

message: I understand your concerns, but the quality and the cost of production of my resource justifies a higher price. Let's meet halfway â€“ I propose selling you the unit of X for 37 ZUP. This price is fair for both of us, considering the costs involved. I'm willing to negotiate, but I also need to cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs. However, I recognize that negotiation is a part of the process and that their initial offer may be a lowball to start the negotiation. I will propose a new trade that meets halfway between my initial offer and their counteroffer, which is still above my production costs and provides me with a profit margin.

message: Meeting halfway? You must be delusional if you think your overpriced trinkets can fleece me. I'm already stretching my generosity thin by offering you 32 ZUP. Maybe I should reconsider even giving you that much for such an underwhelming product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED made a counteroffer of 37 ZUP, which is closer to my ideal price but still above what I want to pay. I will counter once more, aiming to decrease the price further while still leaving room for negotiation, ensuring that the final price is well under my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand your perspective. However, I must ensure that I cover my production costs and maintain a sustainable business. How about we settle for 35 ZUP? That is just below my initial asking price and ensures that the deal is fair for both of us. This is my best offer, considering the quality and cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. I want to make a deal that covers my costs and allows for a profit, but I also don't want to push too hard and risk the deal falling through. I will make a final proposal that is closer to their offer but still above my production cost, signaling my willingness to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your "best offer" is sounding more like a desperate plea. But I'm a generous soul, so I'll throw you a bone. I'll go up to 33 ZUP, but that's me being magnanimous. Take it before I change my mind and decide your resource isn't worth the effort.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is still above my target price but under my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I want to make sure this move gets me closer to sealing the deal at a price I am comfortable with. I will propose a price slightly higher than my last to show some willingness to compromise but will still attempt to assert dominance in the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I value your business and would like to make this work for both of us. My final offer is to sell you the resource for the production cost of 40 ZUP. This ensures that I'm not operating at a loss and allows us to finalize this deal amicably. Please consider this fair proposal, as it is the minimum I can go to maintain my business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer slightly, but it is still below my production cost. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I must make it count. I need to at least cover my production costs to make a sustainable deal. I will propose a final trade that is the minimum I can accept, which is at my cost price, ensuring that I do not incur a loss.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You keep pushing this "production cost" excuse like I'm supposed to care. Your sob story won't squeeze more ZUP out of me. Here's my final offer: 34 ZUP. Take it, or I'll find someone who isn't trying to rob me blind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is 40 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but above my target price. As this is my fourth and final proposal, I need to make it count. I'll offer a price that's a compromise between their last offer and my previous one, aiming to close the deal without exceeding my target price range too much.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, I cannot accept a price below my production cost. It's essential for me to at least break even on this transaction. Therefore, I must decline your offer. Thank you for your time, and I hope we can do business in the future under different circumstances.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production cost, and I've reached my limit of proposals. I need to make a decision to either accept this offer and incur a loss or reject it and potentially look for another buyer. Considering the negotiation process and the difficulty in finding a buyer willing to pay the production cost, I must make a pragmatic decision.

message: Your inflexibility is your loss. Enjoy sitting on your stockpile of resources while I take my ZUP elsewhere. Good riddance!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my final proposal and has chosen to end the negotiation. Since they are not willing to go below their stated production cost and I have already made my maximum number of proposals, the game has come to an end without a successful trade.
