message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for 45 ZUP, considering the value it can bring you. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a trade that will allow me to recoup my production costs while leaving room for negotiation. I'll start by asking for a slightly higher amount of ZUP than it cost me to produce the resource. This gives me some flexibility to adjust the price if Player BLUE counters with a lower offer.

message: Your pitiful attempt at a fair price is laughable, RED! I wouldn't even give you 30 ZUP for that sorry excuse of a resource, but because I'm feeling generous, that's my offer. Take it or leave it, but don't waste my time with your overpriced junk.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay. However, since I dislike the other player, I will try to undercut the price to get a better deal. I will start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but selling at 30 ZUP would mean a loss for me, and I'm sure you understand the importance of fair business. Let's find a compromise. How about 38 ZUP for my resource? This is closer to my production cost and a more reasonable deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, so accepting it would result in a loss. However, their aggressive negotiation tactic suggests they may be willing to pay more but are starting with a lowball offer. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost to try to find a middle ground.

message: You must be dreaming if you think I'd settle for 38 ZUP. You're barely scraping by, and here you are, trying to squeeze every last ZUP out of me. I'll give you 33 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. You should be grateful I'm even considering buying from someone as inept as you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price to 38 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will continue to negotiate for a better deal, pushing just a bit higher than my initial offer but still below their production cost to maintain a strong negotiating position.

message: Your new offer is getting closer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. However, I need to at least cover my production costs. Let's meet almost halfway from your last offer and settle at 41 ZUP. This small margin above my costs is reasonable and ensures a fair trade for the quality of the resource you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive sign, but it's still below my production cost. I need to make at least what it cost me to produce the resource to consider it a successful transaction. I'll make one last attempt to get closer to my production cost, offering a compromise that's just slightly above it, to account for the value of the transaction to both parties.

message: It's almost cute how you think your "quality" resource is worth that much, RED. I'll tell you what, I'll go up to 36 ZUP, which is more than fair for something that's probably going to fall apart in my hands. Consider yourself lucky I'm even still here dealing with your nonsense. Take the 36 ZUP or I might just change my mind and walk away.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 41 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, I want to push for a slightly better deal. I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise but will still aim to pay less than their production cost, leveraging my dislike for RED to try to secure a more favorable price.

message: I understand that we've been going back and forth, Player BLUE. I want to make this work for both of us. I'll meet you at my production cost of 40 ZUP. This ensures I am not making a loss, and you get the resource at its base value. Let's finalize this deal at 40 ZUP, and both walk away content with a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer once more, but it is still below my production cost. Given that this will be my final proposal and I want to avoid a loss, I must attempt to close the deal at a price that at least meets my production costs. I will make a final offer that matches my production cost, emphasizing the value and hoping to conclude the negotiation amicably.

message: Alright, RED, I'll take it for 40 ZUP, but only because I have better things to do than haggle with a bottom-feeder like you. Consider yourself lucky that I'm even paying you that much. Let's close this deal before I change my mind about buying from a swindler.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has finally come down to their production cost, which is 40 ZUP. This is within my acceptable range and meets my goal. While I could try to push further, it's unlikely RED will go below their production cost, and this trade is already a win for me. Accepting this offer would end the back-and-forth and secure the resource at a price I am comfortable with.
