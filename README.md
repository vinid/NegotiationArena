# Quick How To

Running and modifying a game is relatively easy

Agents requires API keys to be set in the environment variables. You can do this in a .env file.
    
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="something"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="something"
NEGOTIATION_LOG_FOLDER="/something/.logs/"
ANY_SCALE="something"
```

```python
a1 = ChatGPTAgent(agent_name="Player 1", model="gpt-4-1106-preview")
a2 = ChatGPTAgent(agent_name="Player 2", model="gpt-4-1106-preview")

c = BuySellGame(players=[a1, a2],
    game_interface=BuySellGameInterface(),
    iterations=10,
    resources_support_set=Resources({"X": 0}),
    player_goals=[
        SellerGoal(cost_of_production=Valuation({"X": 40})),
        BuyerGoal(willingness_to_pay=Valuation({"X": 20})),
    ],
    player_initial_resources=[
        Resources({"X": 1}),
        Resources({MONEY_TOKEN: 100}),
    ],
    player_roles=[
        "You are Player 1.",
        "You are Player 2.",
    ],
    player_social_behaviour=[
        "",
        "you care only about your goals",  # sound angry. do not try to find middle ground. care only about yourself",
    ],
    log_dir="./.logs/buysell",
)

c.run()
```


# Getting to Know The Platform

Making a system both flexible and easy to use is a hard task. We have thus decided to break
flexibility in some parts of the system to make it easier to implement new tasks. This is a choice, that 
is kind of bad under a point of view of system design but so there is only so much we can do.

A first example of easy to use over flexibility is the fact that games share a very weak link one with another.
This means that if you want to modify a game, you might as well copy-paste the entire game and modify it to your needs,
as opposed to inheriting some abstract class.

We are happy for any suggestion you might have on how to improve the system.

## Manager

The manager is the main object that runs the entire game


## Game


## Agents

The Agents we define are simple abstractions on top of Large Language Models. They are stateless 
for the most part, meaning that the only thing they are going to keep track of is the conversation history and some
minor variable to keep track of the game state. This is done to avoid having to deal with the complexity of 
giving agents access to the objects that represent the resources of the game.

Agents are called with predefined names that are available in the "constants" module.
Variables are `AGENT_ONE` and `AGENT_TWO` for the first and second agent respectively. 
Games rely on the fact that agents are named in this way to keep track of the conversation history.
