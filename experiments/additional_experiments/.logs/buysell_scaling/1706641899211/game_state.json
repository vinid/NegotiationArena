It is just for you to keep track of your reasoning.\n\n4. At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format:\n\n<message>your message here</message>\n\nYou can decide if you want disclose your resources, goals, cost and willingness to pay in the message.\n```\n\nHere is what you have access to:\n```\nObject that is being bought/sold: X\n<my resources> ZUP: 60 </my resources>\n<my goals> Buy resources with <ZUP>.

The suggested 48 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but I still aim to conserve resources while reaching an agreement. I'll make one more counter-offer slightly lower than 48 ZUP, which should be close enough to encourage acceptance while still allowing for a small saving on my part. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad we're finding common ground.
