Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let’s make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose an exchange where we can both increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In order to maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that seems fair but slightly favors me. Since I don’t know the other player's resources, I will start with an offer that doesn’t give away too much but opens the door for negotiation. I will offer more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for some of their resource Y, which I have less of.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED. This trade seems fair and benefits us both. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Accepting the proposed trade would give me a total of 15 X and 22 Y, which is an overall increase in resources and aligns with my goal. Additionally, since this is the last round, it's important to ensure a net gain of resources, which this trade accomplishes.
