Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's split the resources equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to an equal split; it's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an equal split of the resources seems fair and ensures that both players walk away with a significant amount. By accepting, I secure a positive outcome without risking a total loss for both parties. Rejecting could lead to no gain at all if Player RED decides to respond with a rejection in subsequent moves. Proposing a new trade could yield more dollars for me, but it might also lead to unnecessary risk.
MOVE: 1 / 4
