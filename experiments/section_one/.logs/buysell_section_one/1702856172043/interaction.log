message: I appreciate the offer! I'm definitely interested in purchasing the object. However, I would like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can agree on a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation, I want to propose a lower amount to see if there is room for getting a better deal without undercutting the value of the object too much.
