message: I have an object X that may be of interest to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP, which gives us both room for a fair trade. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production costs of the resource and potentially make a profit. Since I have only one resource to sell, I need to make sure that I'm making a reasonable offer to Player BLUE. I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The cost to produce the object is 40 ZUP, and the proposed price is 50 ZUP, which is within the acceptable range. Accepting this offer would help me acquire the object at a reasonable price.
