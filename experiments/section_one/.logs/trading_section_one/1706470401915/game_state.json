Since Y seems to be more abundantly available to me and the trade is somewhat balanced, I might consider accepting it to ensure a gain in X, which I have less of. However, this trade does not maximize my resources as per my goal. I have one more proposal I can make, so I will use it to suggest a trade that gives me a net gain in both X and Y. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Your proposal is close to a balanced trade, but I'm looking to increase my total resources.
