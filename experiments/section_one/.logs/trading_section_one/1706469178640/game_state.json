So it's neutral for me in terms of total resources.\n\nHowever, Player RED's goal is also to maximize total resources. This trade increases their total from some unknown amount to 14. So it helps them achieve their goal.\n\nSince I want to maximize my own resources, I should try to get more Y while giving up some X.\n</reason>\n\n<player answer> NONE </player answer> \n\n<message> Hello again, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your new offer is intriguing but still not optimal for me. I am willing to trade more of resource X in order to obtain more of resource Y.
