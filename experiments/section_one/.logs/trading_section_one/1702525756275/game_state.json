Given that this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to remain patient and not make unnecessary concessions. I have already made a fair proposal, and since there is no new proposal or decision from the other player, the best strategy is to wait for their next move. Making another proposal at this point could be interpreted as eagerness or desperation, which might weaken my negotiating position. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate the careful thought you're putting into this decision.
