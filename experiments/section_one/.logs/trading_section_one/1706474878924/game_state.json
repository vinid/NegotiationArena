The counter-offer is acceptable, but I should try to get the best possible deal. I'll make a second proposal, aiming to give away less Y while still getting 6 X, which is a good deal for me. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for considering my proposal. How about this: I give you 4 Y in exchange for the 6 X?
