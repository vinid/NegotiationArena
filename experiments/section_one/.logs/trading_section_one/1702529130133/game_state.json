Since this is the final round, it's important to consider the trade carefully. Given that I have a large amount of Y, parting with 3 units for a substantial increase in X could be beneficial. However, it's essential to retain enough Y to maintain a resource advantage. Accepting the trade would give me more of the resource I have less of, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Additionally, it may be difficult to negotiate a better ratio without knowledge of the other player's resources. Accepting the offer seems reasonable as it increases my total resource count and improves my X to Y ratio. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> The compromise seems fair.
