I have to be careful with my counteroffers as I can only make three, and this trade doesn't seem to be in my favor since I would be giving up a significant amount of my more abundant resource, Y, for a small gain in X.

It's important to maintain a balance and make a trade that benefits my goal of resource accumulation. Since the other player did not accept my first proposal, I'll aim for a trade that is more equal in terms of resource exchange while still trying to increase my total resources. This is my second proposal. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I understand your concern about the trade not being equal. Let's try to find a fair middle ground for both of us. I propose the following trade. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 </newly proposed trade>"
