Since this is the last round and there's no penalty for proposing trades at this point, it might be beneficial to counter-propose to see if a more advantageous trade can be made. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I could attempt to propose a trade that gives me a larger quantity of resources in return for a reasonable amount of my own. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Greetings!

Since our goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not seem beneficial as it stands. I will propose a trade that is more advantageous to me, keeping the quantities small as suggested by Player RED while still trying to gain a net increase in resources. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your offer.
