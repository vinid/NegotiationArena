This is my last chance to propose a trade as I have already made two proposals. I need to make this final proposal count by offering a trade that is likely to be accepted while still aiming to increase my stash of resource X. My previous offers have not been accepted, so I may need to offer slightly more of my Y resources while still ensuring I get a good amount of X in return. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate your commitment to finding a trade that works for both of us.
